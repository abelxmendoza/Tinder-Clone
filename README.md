# Tinder Clone

This repository contains a clone of the popular dating application Tinder. It aims to replicate the core features and functionalities of Tinder, allowing users to swipe through profiles, match with other users, and engage in messaging conversations.

## Features

* Swiping functionality: Users can swipe left or right to indicate their interest or disinterest in other user profiles.

## Technologies Used

The Tinder Clone is built using the following technologies:

* **React** : The front-end user interface is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Node.js** : The back-end server is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js** : Express.js is used as the web application framework for the Node.js server.
* **MongoDB** : MongoDB is used as the database to store user profiles and other relevant data.


## Future Features

* User registration and authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and securely authenticate themselves using their credentials.
* Profile creation: Users can create a profile by providing their basic information, uploading profile pictures, and setting their preferences.
* Matching: When two users swipe right on each other's profiles, a match is created, enabling them to start a conversation.
* Messaging: Matched users can engage in text-based conversations within the application.
* Notifications: Users receive notifications for new matches and messages.
* Location-based matching: Users can find matches within their specified geographical radius.
